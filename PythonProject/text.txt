1.Have the function ArrayChallenge(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr which will contain integers that
represent the amount in dollars that a single stock is worth,and return the maximum profit that could have been made by buying stock on day X
 and selling stock on day Y where Y>X .For example if array is [44,30,24,32,35,30,40,38,15] then your program should return 16 because at index 2
 the stock was worth $24 and at index 6 the stock was then worth $40, so if you brought the stock at $24 and sold it at $40, you would have made a profit of $16,which is the maximum profit
 that could hve been made with this list of stock prices.
